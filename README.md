# Getting started

Ensure you have docker compose installed and run

```
docker compose up -d
```

While the images are downloading, import the postman collection. Once the docker stack is running and stable, run the postman request called `initialize elastic search`.

# Testing

Running all the tests in the postman `Full Inegration testa` collection sequentially. These are not automated and need to be run manually one by one.
